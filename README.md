# slamevaluations

This is just a repo containing the evaluation scripts for SLAM made by the Computer Vision Group in Technical University of Munich's Department of Informatics. I have modified it to work with python3. See this for the original files https://svncvpr.in.tum.de/cvpr-ros-pkg/trunk/rgbd_benchmark/rgbd_benchmark_tools/src/rgbd_benchmark_tools/
